# wps-wagon

Automatic WPS bully tool embedded into a $8 router. Performs WPS attacks to all existing wireless and tries to aumomatically connect to them, and configure DNAT ports inside victim's router using upnpc. It creates a second AP serving internet from victim.

An A5-V11 type router us recommended, but any WiFi OpenWRT capable router is OK. A second WiFi USB dongle is recommended.

Installation:

Put all files in any folder inside the router

Configuration file is settings.sh

Tool can be launched from ./launch.sh script
